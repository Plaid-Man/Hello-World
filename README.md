# Hello-World

The name's Josh. I learned C++ in college and forgot most of it but I wanted to get back into coding because I remember how much I loved creating something from nothing. So I found w3schools and tought myself HTML, CSS and Javascript. Now I want to further my skills and hopefully be pretty good at this stuff one day.
